# Binary search tree

A binary search tree is a tree in which the nodes can have zero to two children that are differentiated between the left child and the right child. Also, the tree has the property that a left child of a node X contains a value less than the value of X and a right child of a node X contains a value greater than the value of X.  

This implementation contains these functions:

- insert: inserts a value into the tree and returns a boolean indicating whether the insertion took place or not.
- remove_node: removes a value from the list and returns a boolean indicating whether the removal occurred or not.
- search: searches a value in the tree and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is in the list or not.
- print: print the tree to stdout in pre-order and formated.
